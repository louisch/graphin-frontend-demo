# Basic Graphin Demo

This repository contains a basic demo of [Graphin](https://github.com/antvis/Graphin)/[G6](https://github.com/antvis/g6) capabilities.

This repository is based on the standard Vite React + SWC scaffolding, with `graphin` installed in addition.

Probably doesn't work on mobile.

## How to run

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Open in browser (console should display what port the dev server is running at).
